# Data Science Portfolio


## Portfolio 1

Portfolio 1 is about exploring Steve Cassidy's 2016 and 2019 cycling and time trial races. In this notebook, I have explored the speed data particularly as it is the most crucial variable in a race. Interestingly, I have also recommended how Steve can potentially increase his race speed after analysing the data.

_The data files come from [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) and are loaded by a custom function_.
