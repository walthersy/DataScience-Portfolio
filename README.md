## Portfolio 1  :bicyclist:

Portfolio 1 is about exploring a cyclist's 2016 and 2019 cycling and time trial races.

In this notebook, I have explored the speed data particularly as it is the most crucial variable in a race.

Interestingly, I have also recommended how Steve can potentially increase his race speed after analysing the data.

_The data files come from [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) and are loaded by a custom function_.

  
  
  
## Portfolio 2  :soccer:


Portfolio 2 is about examining the sports vouchers program in South Australia and whether it is beneficial to more affluent families.

I have also explored the data to see which sports and LGAs standout and whether SEIFA score have something to do with voucher activities.

A similar analysis has also been done for Queensland's sports vouchers program


## Portfolio 3  :phone:

Portfolio 3 is about predicting customer churn from a range of data.
